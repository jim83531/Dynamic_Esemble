# DELR (Dynamic Esemble Learning Research)

1.if you want to try the dataset I used in my experiment set as follow

    for the synthetic data set classnumber = 2, datatset = 1
  
    for the allstate data set classnumber = 2, datatset = 2
  
    for the fashion-mnist data set classnumber = 10, datatset = 3
  
    for the kuzushiji-mnist data set classnumber = 10, datatset = 4
  
after setting all things that metion above run DELR.py

2.if you want to try my method on your own dataset set as follow

    set classnumber to the numbers of class in your dataset
    
    set dataset = 5
    
    set dataname as taskname
    
    rename your dataset as dataname-train and dataname-test
    
after setting all things that metion above run DELR.py
